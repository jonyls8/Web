blogs are something that I like since long time ago, I tried to make a fashion blog with animations to look cool

Blog project with animation, the key on this project was the design, giving nice transitions and effects. In the code level, I use two libraries (Gsap and ScrollMagic)
Which are really useful to build the content faster.
